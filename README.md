## Questions
    
Ran into issues with the notes page not loading as the path was having issues. Found out that you can remove the path value and it was able to get to the page just fine.

Ran into another issue with body being undefined. Was able to be fixed by adding a middle ware call

Ids where made using crypto's uuid generator
